•   Go to preferences by clicking File option in Top. 
•   Now select the network option and create a new NAT network
• After creating a NAT network, now go to virtual machine setting by right clicking on the preferred 
machine. 
•   Now go to Network and change the attached option to “NAT network” and select the network we 
created earlier. 

•   Now repeat the same process for another machine. 


2.   Launch both virtual machines 
 
 
•   Now install “Net-tools” on both machine which will  help to identify i/p address of the machine. 
Command:  sudo apt install net-tools 

• Now create a file in Home folder using any text editor. Here we have used “Test_file.txt” and 
will transfer from Kali Linux (Right Machine) to  Ubuntu (left Machine). 

•   Now we can check i/p address of Ubuntu where we want to transfer the file using “ ifconfig ” 
command. Here Ubuntu has i/p address 10.0.2.4. 

• Transfer the file using command- scp Test_file.txt  raghav@10.0.2.4: 
Where Test_file.txt is our file 
raghav is username of Ubuntu 
10.0.2.4 is ip address of Ubuntu (left machine) 
Optional: if scp is not installed then install by using command: 
sudo apt install openssh-server 

• Now enter the password for Ubuntu(left machine) admin, after enter the password, the file will be 
sent from Kali Linux(Right machine) to Ubuntu (Left machine)
